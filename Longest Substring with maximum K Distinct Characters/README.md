FOR SLIDING WINDOW - HASHMAP APPROACH - ATTEMPT 1

Time Complexity#
The above algorithm’s time complexity will be O(N), where  N is the number of characters in the input string. The outer for loop runs for all characters, and the inner while loop processes each character only once; therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm will be O(N+N), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N).

Space Complexity#
The algorithm’s space complexity is O(K), as we will be storing a maximum of K+1 characters in the HashMap.
