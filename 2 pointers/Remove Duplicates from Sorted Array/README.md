Given an array of sorted numbers, remove all duplicates from it. You should not use any extra space; after removing the duplicates in-place return the length of the subarray that has no duplicate in it.

Input: [2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 9, 9]
Output: 4
Explanation: The first four elements after removing the duplicates will be [2, 3, 6, 9].


2 pointer solution complexities:-

**Time Complexity#
The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of elements in the given array.

**Space Complexity#
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
