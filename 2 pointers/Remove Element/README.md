Given an unsorted array of numbers and a target ‘key’, remove all instances of ‘key’ in-place and return the new length of the array.<br />
<br />
Input: [3, 2, 3, 6, 3, 10, 9, 3], Key=3<br />
Output: 4<br />
Explanation: The first four elements after removing every 'Key' will be [2, 6, 10, 9].<br />

COMPLEXITIES-<br />
The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of elements in the given array.<br />

The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).<br />
