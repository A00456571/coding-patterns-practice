Time Complexity#

The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N).
The outer for loop runs for all elements, and the inner while loop processes each element only once; therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm will be 
O(N+N), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N).

Space Complexity#

The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
